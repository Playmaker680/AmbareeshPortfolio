                        A junior at Dublin High School with a passion in the fields of computer science, biology, and psychology. Concurrently enrolled in various community colleges to advance knowledge in these fields while building connections with qualified professors. The passion for understanding how technology and the human mind intersect creates complex problems which require creative and innovative thinking styles to tackle. Finding solutions for such intricate multidisciplinary problems drives my passion and education. My future goal is to blend these unique disciplines and use my combination of skills to make a positive impact on society. I am very sure that I will be working with other professionals in the near future on new innovations, research, or developing new technology which further develops human society.

                        Beyond my academic interests, I have a wide range of interests and experience. I volunteer at the ISKCON temple and various other mindful organizations, where I engage in meaningful activities. I also teach musical instruments to students internationally, which has helped me develop my communication skills, confidence in the workplace, and patience while working with others. Additionally, I enjoy writing and conducting scientific research in various fields, which has further improved my analytical and critical thinking abilities while also giving me an opportunity to work with various scientists with lifetimes of experience. These are a few of my strongest non-academic related extracurriculars, which in total tally up to over 300 hours of volunteering. Overall, these experiences have equipped me with a well-rounded life skill set, making me a valuable asset to your team. I am enthusiastic about the opportunities life brings and am even more excited to bring my skills and passion to leave a positive mark of change on human society.

                        Oceans are getting polluted more by the day and the current solution isn't to the mark of solving this issue. This problem directly effects the aquatics and aquatic plants. My fellow classmates and I, together worked on a project called AquaGuardAI. AquaGuardAI is a AI based sensor which focuses on tackling sewage discharge and poor water pollution in our oceans. The AI model sensor aims to detect sewage discharge and a negative change in water quality in any given water body. The data will then be transmitted to a live-feed website which has a alarm system showing live sensor activity, location and possible detection. My role in this project was a Web Developer and Co-Project Manager. Specifically, I was responsible for leading the team with meetings, deadlines, coordinating with other members while ensuring that the project milestones were met. I also developed on the beta website which contains all the project information (Home, AI models, About Us, Sponsors) and the frontend of the live-feed page using HTML, CSS and Java Script. This project enhanced my technical skills, where I developed a seamless user friendly high designed website. It also taught me the importance of teamwork and effective communication amongst other workers.

                        Boring rides, lack of interest in modern games, or just feeling minimalistic? TapFast is a multiplayer game where players compete to tap a random moving target the most amount of times in a given duration. The game aims a minimal yet fun way to play with your friends or practice on your own. This game's main objective besides fun competition is to improve reaction time and hand-eye coordination. As the Software Developer for this project, I developed the game mechanics, emphasizing the user experience in a intuitive UI/UX design. The game goes along a minimalistic design inducing competition as the main user objective. During development, I conducted various testing sessions to gather and document feedback, which I used to further improve the game's design and functionality. This project allowed me to further master MIT App Inventor programing which was foundational to my future projects.

                        A part of me is a researcher aiming to contributing to science and technology. Specifically, at my ASDRP Research Internship opportunity, I study plant micropropagation and organogenesis, analyzing variables correlating with optimal in-vitro growth. As the lead researcher, I am responsible for designing experiments, collecting and analyzing data, and presenting findings at various Poster, Expo, Colloquia, Presentational events at different colleges. This project has provided me with hands-on experience in advanced biological techniques and data analysis. It also allowed me to collaborate with other experienced researchers, further developing my ability to work in a team of lifelong research experts who dedicated decade worths of innovation to the scientific community. I also learnt to communicate scientific concepts effectively, as it is fundamental in process of research. The project's findings have the potential to contribute to advancements in agricultural biotechnology making fruit plant production affordable and accessible by In-Vitro growth

                        Outside of my lab research, I also read and write various research articles on innovative and inducing topics. Specifically, over the last year, I have written review articles on two significant topics: parental toxic stress and its impact on child development, and political solutions to illegal immigration. The first article explores how chronic stress within parents can affect the cognitive and emotional development of their children, highlighting the pro's and con's of various solutions within the mental support techniques. The second article examines current approaches to managing illegal immigration within the United States, highlighting the need for the optimal solution. These articles involved research from various databases, practical analysis, and collection of sources from top tier peer reviewed journals and scientific research. Writing these articles has shaped my ability to communicate complex ideas clearly and concisely, a skill crucial for both academic and professional success. It also helped me shape arguments on complex topics and deliver the information in a respectful and evidence based manner.
